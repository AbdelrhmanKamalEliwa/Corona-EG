"infiction_methods_title_1" = "How is COVID-19 disease spread?";
"infiction_methods_description_1" = "People can catch COVID-19 infections from other people who have the virus. The disease is spread mainly from person to person through small droplets secreted by a person have COVID-19 from his nose or mouth when he coughs, sneezes or speaks. These droplets are relatively heavy in weight, as they do not travel to a remote location but rather fall quickly to the ground. People can catch COVID-19 disease if they breathe these droplets from someone who has the virus. Therefore it is important to keep at least 1 meter (3 feet) from others. These droplets may land on objects and surfaces surrounding the person, such as tables, door handles, and stair handrails. People can then become infected when they touch these objects or surfaces and then touch their eyes, nose, or mouth. Therefore, it is important to wash regularly the washing of hands with soap and water or to clean them with an alcohol disinfectant to rub the hands.";

"infiction_methods_title_2" = "What is Corona virus?";
"infiction_methods_description_2" = "Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses that may cause disease in animals and humans. It is known that a number of coronaviruses in humans cause respiratory infections that range from common colds to more severe diseases such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The recently discovered Coronavirus causes the Corvid-19 virus.";

"infiction_methods_title_3" = "What is Covid-19 disease?";
"infiction_methods_description_3" = "The COVID-19 disease is an infectious disease caused by the recently discovered Coronavirus. There was no knowledge of this virus and this emerging disease before the outbreak of the outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019.";

"infiction_methods_title_4" = "What are the symptoms of COVID-19 disease?";
"infiction_methods_description_4" = "The most common symptoms of COVID-19 disease are fever, fatigue, and dry cough. Some patients may experience pain, aches, nasal congestion, cold, sore throat, or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected without showing any symptoms and without feeling ill. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without the need for special treatment. And the severity of the disease intensifies in approximately one person out of every 6 people who develop COVID-19 infection, who suffer from difficulty breathing. The risk of the elderly and people with basic medical problems such as high blood pressure, heart disease, or diabetes are severe. About 2% of people who have contracted the disease have died. People with fever, cough, and difficulty breathing should seek medical care.";

"infiction_methods_title_5" = "Can the virus be transmitted through the air?";
"infiction_methods_description_5" = "Studies conducted to this day indicate that the virus that causes COVID-19 disease is transmitted primarily through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.";

"infiction_methods_title_6" = "Can a person get sick by an asymptomatic person?";
"infiction_methods_description_6" = "The main method of transmission of the disease is the respiratory droplets that a person secretes when coughing. The risk of COVID-19 disease is diminished by someone asymptomatic. But many people with the disease have only slight symptoms. This is especially true in the early stages of the disease. Therefore, COVID-19 can be infected by a person who suffers from a mild cough and does not feel ill. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the transmission period of COVID-19 and will continue to publish the latest findings.";

"infiction_methods_title_7" = "Can I catch COVID-19 disease by stools of someone who has the disease?";
"infiction_methods_description_7" = "The risk of transmission of COVID-19 disease through the stool of an infected person is limited. While initial investigations suggest that the virus may be present in feces in some cases, it's spread through this pathway is not a major feature of the outbreak. An introduction to WHO is assessing ongoing research on ways to spread COVID-19 disease and will continue to publish new findings. But it includes a risk to it, you can set up another reason to clean hands regularly after using the toilet and before eating.";

"infiction_methods_title_8" = "What are the odds of getting COVID-19 disease?";
"infiction_methods_description_8" = "For most people in most places, the risk of COVID-19 infection remains low. However, there are some places in the world (cities or regions) where the disease is currently spreading. The risk of developing COVID-19 infection is higher for people who live in or visit these areas. Governments and health authorities are now taking strict measures whenever a new case of COVID-19 is revealed. So, make sure that you comply with any restrictions imposed locally on travel, transportation, or large gatherings. Cooperation with the agencies concerned with disease control would reduce the risk and spread of COVID-19 disease.";

"infiction_methods_title_9" = "Should I be concerned about COVID-19 disease?";
"infiction_methods_description_9" = "The disease caused by infection with the emerging coronavirus (COVID-19) is generally mild, especially in children and young adults. However, it can cause serious illness, as about 1 in 5 people with this disease need hospital care. Therefore, it is only natural for people to be concerned about how the outbreak of COVID-19 disease affects them and their loved ones.";

"infiction_methods_title_10" = "Who are at risk for severe disease?";
"infiction_methods_description_10" = "We still know the impact of COVID-19 disease on people, yet it appears that the elderly and people with existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes) have more severe illness than others.";

"infiction_methods_title_11" = "Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating COVID-2019 disease?";
"infiction_methods_description_11" = "No. Antibiotics do not eliminate viruses, they only eliminate bacterial infections. Since COVID-19 disease is caused by a virus, antibiotics do not eliminate it. Antibiotics should not be used as a means to prevent or treat COVID-19 disease. It should only be used in accordance with your doctor's instructions to treat bacterial infections.";

"infiction_methods_title_12" = "Are there any medications or treatments that protect or treat COVID-19 disease?";
"infiction_methods_description_12" = "While some western, traditional, or home medicines may relieve or reduce some of the symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that there are currently medications that can prevent or treat this disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medications, including antibiotics, either to prevent or treat COVID-19 disease. However, there are several clinical trials underway that include both western and traditional medicines. WHO will continue to provide updated information in this regard when clinical results are available.";

"infiction_methods_title_13" = "Is there a vaccine, medicine, or treatment for COVID-2019?";
"infiction_methods_description_13" = "Not yet. To date, there is neither a vaccine nor a specific antiviral medication to prevent or treat COVID-2019 disease. However, those with it should receive care to relieve symptoms. You can admit people with severe illnesses to hospitals. Most patients recover with supportive care. Investigation of some of the potential vaccines and drugs specific to the treatment of this disease is being investigated. Tested by clinical trials. WHO has made efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19 disease. This is like the most effective way to protect yourself and others from COVID-19 disease by persisting in cleaning hands, covering the mouth when coughing by bending the elbow or a tissue and keeping a distance of at least one meter (3 feet) from people who cough or sneeze. (See: How can I protect myself with the current spread of the disease?).";

"infiction_methods_title_14" = "Is Covid-19 disease the same as SARS?";
"infiction_methods_description_14" = "No. There is a genetic connection between the virus that causes COVID-19 and the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), but they are different. SARS is more deadly than COVID-19, but it is much less infected than it is. No place in the world has seen any SARS outbreak since 2003.";

"infiction_methods_title_15" = "Should I put a mask to protect myself?";
"infiction_methods_description_15" = "Do not wear a mask unless you have symptoms of COVID-19 disease (especially coughing) or if you are caring for someone who may have this disease. You can only use the single-use mask only once. If you are not sick or if you care for a sick person, you will have wasted a mask unnecessarily. Allows the shortage of masks to be used globally, the organization is urging people to be wise to use them. The organization recommends that rags be used rationally to avoid unnecessarily wasting and misusing valuable resources (see guidance on using masks). This is like the most effective way to protect yourself and others from COVID-19 disease by cleaning your hands frequently and covering the mouth when coughing by bending the elbow or a tissue, and leaving a distance of at least one meter (3 feet) from people who cough or sneeze. For more information, see basic protection measures against the emerging coronavirus.";

"infiction_methods_title_16" = "How long does COVID-19 incubation take?";
"infiction_methods_description_16" = "The term (incubation period) refers to the period from infection with the virus to the onset of symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the COVID-19 incubation period range from 1 to 14 days, which lasts five days. These estimates will be updated as more data becomes available.";

"infiction_methods_title_17" = "Could COVID-19 infection be transmitted to humans from an animal source?";
"infiction_methods_description_17" = "Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses common among bats and animals. People rarely become infected with these viruses, which they then pass on to others. Examples are the Coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which has been associated with civet cats, and the Coronavirus, the respiratory syndrome in the Middle East, which has transmitted through camels. The potential animal sources of COVID-19 disease have not been confirmed. To protect yourself, when visiting live animal markets, avoid direct contact with animals and with animal contact surfaces. Be sure to follow good food safety practices at all times by using due diligence when dealing with raw meat, raw milk, and animal organs to avoid contamination of uncooked food, and avoid eating raw or undercooked animal products.";

"infiction_methods_title_18" = "Can I get COVID-19 disease from my pet?";
"infiction_methods_description_18" = "Although the case of a dog with COVID-19 infection has been reported in Hong Kong, there is still no scientific evidence that the COVID-19 infection can be transmitted from a dog, cat, or any pet. COVID-19 is mainly caused by droplets secreted by the infected person when he coughs, sneezes, or speaks. To protect yourself from infection, clean your hands frequently and frequently. The World Health Organization continues to monitor the latest research in this and other subjects related to COVID-19 and is keen to update this information as new findings become available.";

"infiction_methods_title_19" = "How long will the virus stay alive on rooftops?";
"infiction_methods_description_19" = "It is not known with certainty how long the virus that causes COVID-19 is alive on the surfaces, but it appears to be similar to other coronaviruses. Studies can be done that coronaviruses (including preliminary information about the virus that causes COVID-19 disease) may remain alive on the surfaces for a few hours or several days. This may vary depending on conditions (such as surface type, temperature, or environmental humidity). If you think a surface may be contaminated, clean it with a regular disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands by rubbing them with an alcohol cleaner or by washing them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose.";

"infiction_methods_title_20" = "Is it safe to receive parcels from areas that have reported cases of COVID-19 disease?";
"infiction_methods_description_20" = "Yes. The risk of contamination of commercial goods by an infected person is low, and the risk of contracting the virus that causes COVID-19 disease by expelling transport and shipping and exposing conditions and temperatures is minimal.";

//Prevention Tips
"prevention_tips_title_1" = "Clean your hands regularly, by rubbing them with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer or by washing them with soap and water. Why? Cleaning your hands with soap and water or rubbing them with an alcohol disinfectant will kill the viruses that may be on your hands.";

"prevention_tips_title_2" = "Keep at least one meter (3 feet) between you and anyone coughing or sneezing. Why? When a person coughs or sneezes, small liquid droplets may contain from their nose or mouth that may contain the virus. This was very close to you. You can breathe these droplets, including the virus that causes COVID-19, if the person has it.";

"prevention_tips_title_3" = "When a person coughs or sneezes, small liquid droplets may contain from their nose or mouth that may contain the virus. This was very close to you. You can breathe these droplets, including the virus that causes Covid-19, if the person has it.";

"prevention_tips_title_4" = "Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can catch viruses. If the hands are contaminated, they may transfer the virus to the eyes, nose, or mouth. The virus can enter the body through these outlets and make you sick.";

"prevention_tips_title_5" = "Ensure that you and those around you follow good respiratory hygiene practices. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and then immediately disposing of the used tissue. Why? Drips spread the virus. Having good respiratory practices protects the people around you from viruses such as cold viruses, influenza, and Covid-19.";

"prevention_tips_title_6" = "Stay home if you feel sick. If you have a fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention, and contact your care provider before going to him. Follow the directions of the local health authorities. Why? The most recent information on the situation in your area is available to national and local authorities. Your pre-contact with your healthcare provider will allow him to direct you quickly to the appropriate health care facility. This will protect you and prevent the spread of viruses and other infections.";

"prevention_tips_title_7" = "Stay up to date on the latest developments in COVID-19 disease. Follow the advice of your health care provider, national and local public health authorities, or your employer on how to protect yourself and others from COVID-19 disease. Why? The latest information on whether COVID-19 disease is spreading in your area is available to national and local authorities. They are best able to advise on what actions people in your area can take to protect themselves.";

"prevention_tips_title_8" = "Keep up-to-date on the latest information on hotbeds of COVID-19 infection (cities or localities where COVID-19 disease is widespread). And avoid traveling to these places as much as possible, especially if you are elderly, have diabetes, or have a heart or lung disease. Why? Because you are more likely to get COVID-19 infection in one of these areas.";
